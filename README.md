# QuantumOpenSystem

A modular Python project for simulating open quantum systems using the Quantum Jump Monte Carlo (QJMC) method.

## Structure

- `notebooks/QJMC.ipynb`: Main demonstration and analysis notebook.
- `src/`: Modular Python code for simulation and analysis.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for core modules.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook in `notebooks/`.

## Features

- QJMC simulation for two-level and interacting atoms.
- Modular, maintainable codebase.
- Ready for extension and research use.
